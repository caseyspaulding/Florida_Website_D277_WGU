        Various Native American groups have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan
        Ponce de León became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida ([la floˈɾiða] for
        its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish). Florida subsequently became the first area
        in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the Spanish colony of St. Augustine,
        founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. Florida was repeatedly contested by Spain and
        Great Britain before being ceded to the U.S. in 1819; it was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845.
        Florida was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the longest and most extensive of the
        Indian Wars in U.S. history. The state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven
        original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after the Civil War on June 25, 1868.

        <blockquote>
          "The current design of Florida's state flag was adopted in 1900. In that year, Florida voters ratified a
          constitutional amendment based on an 1899 joint resolution of the state legislature to add diagonal red bars,
          in the form of a St. Andrew's cross, to the flag.
