        in Florida's Capitol over the years have reflected the growth of the state. In the early 1820s, legislators
        transferred
        government business from St. Augustine to Pensacola for alternating sessions. Travel was hazardous and took
        almost
        twenty days - clearly an unsatisfactory arrangement. As a result, Tallahassee was chosen as the capital of
        American
        Florida in 1824, primarily because it was the midway point between the two principal cities.
        <br />

        

        Various Native American groups have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan
        Ponce de León became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida ([la floˈɾiða] for
        its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish). Florida subsequently became the first area
        in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the Spanish colony of St. Augustine,
        founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. Florida was repeatedly contested by Spain and
        Great Britain before being ceded to the U.S. in 1819; it was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845.
        Florida was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the longest and most extensive of the
        Indian Wars in U.S. history. The state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven
        original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after the Civil War on June 25, 1868.
        <br />
        <br />
        Three log cabins served as Florida's first Capitol. In 1826, a two-story masonry building, 40' X 26', was built.
        It was
        to be the wing of a larger sturcture planned for the future. Although this larger portion was started, it was
        never
        completed due to financial problems.

        As Florida moved toward statehood, the needs of government grew. There arose a demand for a suitable state house
        or
        public building for the use of the Territorial Legislature. On March 3, 1839, Congress appropriated $20,000 for
        the
        erection of a new Capitol. The old structure was razed immediately, and Florida's government temporarily moved
        into
        rented quarters.
