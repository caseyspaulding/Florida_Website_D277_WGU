        Jacksonville is a city located on the Atlantic coast of northeastern Florida, the most populous city proper in the state
        and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States as of 2020.[9] It is the seat of Duval County,[10] with
        which the city government consolidated in 1968. Consolidation gave Jacksonville its great size and placed most of its
        metropolitan population within the city limits. As of 2020, Jacksonville's population is 949,611,[11] making it the most
        populous city in the Southeastern United States and the largest in the South outside the state of Texas.[12] With a
        population of 1,733,937, the Jacksonville metropolitan area ranks as Florida's fourth-largest metropolitan region.[7]
