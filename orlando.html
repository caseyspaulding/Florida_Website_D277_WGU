        Orlando is one of the most-visited cities in the world primarily due to tourism, major events, and convention traffic.
        In 2018, the city drew more than 75 million visitors.[citation needed] The Orlando International Airport is the
        13th-busiest airport in the United States and the 29th-busiest in the world.[3] The two largest and most internationally
        renowned tourist attractions in the Orlando area are the Walt Disney World Resort, opened by the Walt Disney Company in
        1971 and located about 21 miles (34 km) southwest of downtown Orlando in Bay Lake, and the Universal Orlando Resort,
        opened in 1990 as a major expansion of Universal Studios Florida and the only theme park inside Orlando city limits.
